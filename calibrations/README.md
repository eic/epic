## Calibrations for the EPIC detector

Calibrations and constants for this EPIC detector setup. These values are used in the
reconstruction. Each relevant subsystem that requires calibration data should have
its own subdirectory with relevant calibration files, preferably in JSON format.

Note that these calibrations are strongly versioned and tied directy to this specific
detector configuration. Therefore, please do not add an extra layer of versioning in the
file names, but rather only add those calibrations relevant for this particular setup.

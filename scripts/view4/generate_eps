#
#       input-file : Source DAWN-format file describing a 3D scene.
#
#       output-file: Output DAWN-format file describing a plane-clipped
#                    3D scene.  The default output stream is stdout.
#
#       a, b, c, d : Parameters  a, b, c, and d  are double values to
#                    define a clipping plane described with the following
#                    equation:
#
#                       ax + by + cz + d = 0.
#
#                    Vector (a,b,c) defines the normal vector of
#                    the clipping plane.
#                    3D scene data in the half space at the front side
#                    of the clipping plane are clipped out and erased.
#                    The normal vector (a,b,c) needs not be a unit vector.
#                    If it is a unit vector, parameter "d" gives distance
#                    between the clipping plane and origin (0,0,0).
